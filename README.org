A collection of useful Emacs Lisp code that isn't substantial enough to be packaged.  This code will be maintained here so that it can be updated and improved over time.

This can be viewed directly on the [[http://github.com/alphapapa/unpackaged.el][repository]] or as [[http://alphapapa.github.io/unpackaged.el][HTML]].

** Track metadata from MPRIS-supporting media player                  :DBus:

Return the artist, album, and title of the track playing in MPRIS-supporting player.  Returns a string in format =ARTIST - ~ALBUM~: ~TITLE~ [PLAYER]=.  If no track is playing, returns nil.

** Read-only trees

This code applies the =read-only= text-property to trees tagged =read_only=, preventing them from being modified accidentally.  (Note: If read-only headings appear in an Agenda buffer, it can cause slightly unusual behavior.  Usually this is not an issue.)  This was originally inspired by John Kitchin's [[http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2014/09/13/Make-some-org-sections-read-only/][blog article]] and later [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/92k7n1/guide_to_profiling_and_optimizing_an_orgrelated/][rewritten]] in a faster version.

To use, load these functions, and then add to this hook to automatically mark read-only sections when an Org file is loaded:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'unpackaged/org-mark-read-only)
#+END_SRC

This isn't always perfect, because dates in a git commit log are not always in order (e.g. when commits are merged at a later date), but it's often very helpful to visually group commits by their age.

*** Tasks

**** TODO Instructions/example

**** TODO Make useful interactively

e.g. it should allow selecting directories, and then presenting the images in them.  Maybe filenames should also be displayed next to each image.  So maybe it should somehow be a wrapper or advice to ~helm-find-files~ or ~helm-comp-read~ that simply adds images to the filename strings.

I love Emacs and Org mode.  This makes it so easy to make the document...alive!  And automated!  Beautiful.
